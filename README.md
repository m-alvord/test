# Loops
This lesson introduces `for` loops as a way to repeatedly run code.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- Recite basic `for` loop syntax
  - `for x in range(NUM):\n\t`
- Create many-looping turtle drawings
- Update existing turtle examples

## Lesson Outline
The lesson consists of these parts:

### Warm-Up: Do Now
Instruct students to complete the [warm-up activity](WarmUpLoops.md) on their own.

### Lecture: Loops
Present the [Loops PowerPoint](Loops.pptx).

### Formative Assessment: Blooket
Facilitate the [Blooket quiz game](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/659c0ae647d83f451d6ecaf0).

### Code-Along: Turtle Loops
Walk through the [code-along instructions](CodeAlongLoops.md) with the students to make some looping turtles.

### Challenges
Students can follow [the instructions](ChallengesLoops.md) to modify their programs in some fun and challenging ways.
